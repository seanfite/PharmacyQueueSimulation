#PharmacyQueueSimulation

The program uses a queue data structure to represent the patient queue at the pharmacy. Patients are enqueued based on their arrival times, and the pharmacy serves them in a first-come, first-served manner. The simulation tracks patient wait times and provides insights into the efficiency of the pharmacy's service.
